### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Project title: Is there any differences between one-term Presidents and multi-terms Presidents
  in their nomination and inaugural speeches?
+ This project is conducted by Qian Shi

+ Project summary: Nomination and inaugural speeches are the first step of Presidents. These speeches indicate what Presidents advocate and what's intended policy they would conduct during tenure, which undoubtedly affect the decision of voters. However, some Presidents owned only one term while others perfoRmed two-or-more terms? What's the reason? Is it possible that these can be seen from their nominaton and inaugural speeches, which convey their thoughts directly to voters? 
         In this project, we would analyze the nomination and inaugural speeches of past presidents, and try to figure out whether there is any differences between those one-term PresidenTs and multi-terms Presidents in their speeches, or on the opposite way, their differences cannot be figured out from just speeches.
